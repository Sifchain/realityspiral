    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nThe current error handling mechanism in the Todo application does not provide sufficient information on failures, making it challenging to debug issues effectively.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nEnhance the error handling to capture detailed error messages, stack traces, and context about the operation being performed. This includes:\n- Logging the operation type (e.g., adding, deleting, marking complete)\n- Capturing the input parameters that led to the error\n- Including timestamps and user context when applicable\n\n**Code Example**\n\n```javascript\nfunction handleError(error, operation) {\n    console.error(`Error during ${operation}:`, error.message);\n    console.error('Stack trace:', error.stack);\n    // Additional context can be logged here\n}\n```\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nKeeping the existing error handling practices, but this would hinder our ability to troubleshoot effectively.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nImproving error handling will facilitate faster debugging and help maintain the reliability of the todo application.\n\n**Related Issues**\n- [Issue #18](https://github.com/snobbee/todo-list/issues/18)\n- [Issue #17](https://github.com/snobbee/todo-list/issues/17)",

    "title": "Issue Created: Implement Enhanced User Input Validation for Todo Operations",
    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nCurrently, users can create and manipulate todos without sufficient input validation, which may lead to empty or invalid entries. This can result in a poor user experience and data integrity issues in the application.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nImplement enhanced input validation for all user inputs related to todo operations. This includes:\n- Validating that todos cannot be empty or consist solely of whitespace.\n- Providing clear feedback to users when their input is invalid.\n- Ensuring that inputs conform to expected formats (e.g., character limits).\n\n**Code Example**\n\n```javascript\nconst inquirer = require('inquirer');\n\nasync function addTodo() {\n    const { todo } = await inquirer.prompt([\n        {\n            type: 'input',\n            name: 'todo',\n            message: 'Enter your todo:'\n        }\n    ]);\n\n    // Enhanced validation for empty or invalid todos\n    if (!todo || !todo.trim() || todo.length > 100) {\n        console.log('⚠️  Todo cannot be empty and must be under 100 characters!');\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Proceed to add the todo\n}\n```\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nAllowing todos to be added without validation, but this can lead to issues with maintaining a clean todo list and user frustration.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nAdding input validation will improve the user experience by preventing invalid inputs and ensuring that the todo list remains meaningful and manageable.\n\n**Related Issues**\n- [Issue #16](https://github.com/snobbee/todo-list/issues/16)\n- [Issue #15](https://github.com/snobbee/todo-list/issues/15)",
