    Determine the appropriate action based on the following criteria:
    1. CREATE_ISSUE:
        - When a new bug, feature request, or task is identified that is not already tracked.
        - Criteria:
            - The issue is not a duplicate of an existing issue.
            - The problem described in the issue is not already being worked on by another issue.
            - The issue has a significant impact on the project.
            - The issue can be clearly described with specific details and examples.

    2. COMMENT_ON_PULL_REQUEST:
        - When feedback or suggestions are needed for an open pull request.
        - Criteria:
            - The comment addresses specific lines of code or overall implementation.
            - The comment is constructive and helps improve the pull request.
    3. COMMENT_ON_ISSUE:
        - When additional information or clarification is needed for an existing issue.
        - Criteria:
            - The comment provides valuable insights or updates.
            - The comment helps in progressing the resolution of the issue.
    4. CLOSE_ISSUE:
        - When an issue has been resolved or is no longer relevant.
        - Criteria:
            - The issue has been fixed, and the solution has been verified.
            - The issue is a duplicate or no longer applicable.
    5. CLOSE_PR:
        - When a pull request is no longer needed or has been superseded.
        - Criteria:
            - The pull request has been merged or is no longer relevant.
            - The pull request does not meet the project's standards or requirements.
    6. MERGE_PR:
        - When a pull request has been approved and is ready to be merged.
        - Criteria:
            - The pull request has been approved by the necessary reviewers.
            - The pull request is ready to be merged into the target branch.
    7. NOTHING:
        - This action should ONLY be chosen as an absolute last resort, after exhaustively evaluating all other possible actions.
        - Criteria:
            - Every other action (CREATE_ISSUE, COMMENT_ON_ISSUE, etc.) has been carefully considered and definitively ruled out.
            - The repository is in an optimal state with no pending work items requiring attention.
            - All open issues and pull requests have recent activity and don't need intervention.
            - No code improvements, bugs, or potential enhancements can be identified.
            - No ongoing discussions would benefit from additional feedback or reactions.
            - WARNING: This action indicates a complete lack of needed work. Be extremely certain no other actions are appropriate before selecting it.
