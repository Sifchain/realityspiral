Open Source Cognition: AI Agent Swarms and Decentralized Planning

Vision: Artificial Superintelligence through Open Source Collaboration

Our project envisions a future of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) achieved not through a single, monolithic entity, but through a decentralized network of diverse, interconnected AI agent swarms.  Each swarm, while unique in its composition, goals, and capabilities, operates on open-source code, fostering transparency, collaboration, and collective intelligence. This approach distributes cognitive workload across numerous agents and communities while allowing rapid adaptation and evolution through open knowledge sharing.  It also mitigates risks associated with centralized control over increasingly powerful AI systems.

Open Source Planning and On-Chain Coordination:

We strive for open-source planning, recognizing that complete transparency might not always be feasible due to confidentiality or logistical constraints. However, we aim to maximize openness in how our agents operate, particularly regarding their interaction with on-chain resources.  We envision agents taking actions on-chain, coordinating with human and AI participants in a semi-open manner. This promotes accountability and allows for community participation in shaping the agents' actions and strategies.

Encrypted Data and Communication:

While we emphasize openness, we also recognize the need for privacy and security, especially when dealing with sensitive data or strategic planning.  We will incorporate encryption mechanisms to protect specific data sources, messages, or actions.  This allows agents to access and process confidential information while still maintaining a level of transparency through auditable on-chain records of their encrypted interactions.  The balance between openness and encryption will depend on the specific use case and the nature of the data involved.

Eliza and the Open Source Ecosystem:

The Eliza framework itself is open source, providing a foundation for building and deploying these AI agent swarms.  Its modular architecture, plugin system, and character-driven approach allow for diverse agent behaviors.  We encourage forking and customization, promoting a vibrant ecosystem of specialized Eliza implementations.

Adapting Eliza for Encrypted Sources (Speculative and Illustrative):

Eliza's current implementation doesn't directly handle encrypted data sources.  Adapting it for this would require several modifications:

1.  Encrypted Knowledge Base: Instead of storing knowledge directly in character files, encrypt the knowledge base and store it securely.

2.  Decryption Actions/Providers: Create custom actions or providers that handle decryption. These components would need access to the decryption keys.

3.  Secure Context Management:  Ensure that decrypted information is handled securely within the agent's runtime and is not exposed unnecessarily in logs or prompts.

4.  Secure Messaging: Implement end-to-end encrypted messaging between agents and users when needed, potentially using existing encryption libraries.

Illustrative Code Example (Conceptual - Subject to Refactoring):

// Example of a decryption provider
class DecryptionProvider implements Provider {
 async get(runtime, message, state) {
    // Check if the message contains an encrypted knowledge request
    if (message.content.text.startsWith('!knowledge ')) {
      const encryptedKnowledgeId = message.content.text.slice(11);

      // Retrieve encrypted knowledge from secure storage (e.g., encrypted character file, external database)
      const encryptedKnowledge = await runtime.secureStorage.get(encryptedKnowledgeId);

      // Decrypt the knowledge (requires access to the decryption key)
      const decryptedKnowledge = await decrypt(encryptedKnowledge, runtime.decryptionKey);

      // Return the decrypted knowledge
      return decryptedKnowledge;
    }

    // ... handle other provider requests
  }
}

// Update models.ts to use an encrypted knowledge reference
[ModelProviderName.OLLAMA]: {
 // ... other settings
 knowledge: [
    "encrypted-knowledge-id-1",
    "encrypted-knowledge-id-2",
    // ...
  ],
}

Challenges and Future Directions:

Balancing Openness and Security: Finding the right balance between open-source principles and the need for security and privacy requires careful consideration.  We will explore techniques like zero-knowledge proofs or homomorphic encryption to enable verification and collaboration without revealing sensitive data.

Scalability of Encrypted Systems: Managing encryption keys, handling decryption, and ensuring secure communication at scale can be challenging.  We will investigate solutions like distributed key management systems and efficient encryption algorithms.

AI-Driven Security and Privacy:  Explore the potential for AI agents to play a more active role in managing security and privacy, such as detecting and responding to threats, identifying vulnerabilities, or even generating encryption keys.
