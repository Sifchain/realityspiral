## Overview

This repository contains the following key components:

- `agent`: Core agent implementation and management
- `plugins/`: Integration plugins including:
  - Coinbase integration for cryptocurrency-related features
  - GitHub integration for repository management
- `clients/`: Integration clients including:
  - Coinbase integration for cryptocurrency-related automations
  - GitHub integration for repository automation
- `ui`: A modern web application built with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS that serves as the main user interface for Reality Spiral AI chat experience

## Technology Stack

The entire codebase is written in TypeScript and utilizes:
- React for the frontend
- Vite for build tooling
- TailwindCSS for styling
- ElizaOS packages for core AI functionality
- Turborepo for monorepo management

## Development

To get started with development:

Install `biome` globally on your system and configure it in your preferred code editor before proceeding.

Here is an example of how to enable biome on VSCode:

1. Install the Biome extension from the VSCode marketplace
2. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)
3. Type "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)"
4. Add the following to the JSON file and save:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSaveMode": "modifications",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.formatOnSaveMode": "modifications",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "[typescript]": {
      "editor.defaultFormatter": "biomejs.biome"
  },
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
      "quickfix.biome": "explicit"
  },
  "[jsonc]": {
      "editor.defaultFormatter": "biomejs.biome"
  },
  "[typescriptreact]": {
      "editor.defaultFormatter": "biomejs.biome"
  }
}
```

Then execute these commands to set up the development environment:

```sh
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development servers
pnpm dev

# Start with a specific character

# start with staff-engineer
CHARACTER=characters/staff-engineer.character.json pnpm dev

# start with prosper
CHARACTER=characters/prosper.character.json pnpm dev

# start with staff-engineer and prosper
CHARACTERS=characters/staff-engineer.character.json,characters/prosper.character.json pnpm dev
```

### Building

To build all apps and packages:

```sh
pnpm build
```
